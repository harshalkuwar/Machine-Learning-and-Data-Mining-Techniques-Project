# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Mining-Techniques-Project

Overview
This project focuses on leveraging advanced machine learning and data mining techniques to address three significant tasks:

1) Environmental Risk Prediction (Classification) - 
Using machine learning models to predict environmental risks based on key factors such as air quality and weather conditions.

2) Patient Segmentation and Risk Analysis (Clustering) - Applying clustering algorithms to segment patients based on healthcare data for enhanced healthcare insights.

3) Sentiment Analysis - Implementing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify customer feedback into positive and negative sentiments.
The project aims to showcase a robust approach to real-world data challenges, demonstrating the power of machine learning and big data analytics.
